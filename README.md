# Refactoring Efforts Data Mining Project

## Overview

This project aims to analyze refactoring efforts in various open-source repositories using the Refactoring Miner tool. It is designed to extract unique repositories, clone them, and perform a refactoring analysis to generate insights.

### Project Structure

- **LoggerManager.py**:
  - Sets up and retrieves loggers for different operations (e.g., `RefactoringRunner.py`). Creates the `Logs` directory with a framework to create a dedicated subdirectory for each operation's logs.

- **ProduceUniqueRepos.py**:
  - Extracts unique project names from a CSV file and generates corresponding GitHub repository URLs. The URLs are outputted to a file named `uniqueRepositories.txt` in the `UniqueRepositoriesOutput` directory.

- **RefactoringRunner.py**:
  - Clones a GitHub repository and runs Refactoring Miner to analyze refactoring efforts. The analysis results are saved as JSON files in the `RefactoringMinerOutputs` directory.

- **Runner.py**:
  - Reads the list of repositories from `uniqueRepositories.txt` and runs refactoring analysis on a predefined number of repositories.

### Directories

- **RefactoringMinerOutputs**:
  - Stores the output JSON files containing the results of the refactoring analysis.

- **UniqueRepositoriesOutput**:
  - Contains the `uniqueRepositories.txt` file, which stores the GitHub repository URLs generated by `ProduceUniqueRepos.py`.
### Usage

1. Run `ProduceUniqueRepos.py` to generate a list of unique repositories.
   ```bash
   python ProduceUniqueRepos.py

2. Run Runner.py to start analyzing repositories listed in uniqueRepositories.txt.
python Runner.py

3. Check the RefactoringMinerOutputs directory for the results of the refactoring analysis in JSON format.

### Dependencies
Python 3.x
Git (for cloning repositories)
Java (for running Refactoring Miner)
Refactoring Miner (should be installed and placed in the appropriate directory)


### Notes
The project assumes that the repositories are hosted under the Apache GitHub organization.
Modify Runner.py to change the number of repositories to be analyzed.
